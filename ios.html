                <h2> How to Take Control of Apple News Alerts in iOS 11 </h2>

                <p> 
                    Apple News is the built-in news app for iOS 11 that aggregates and curates stories and topics from a variety of third-party news sources. 
                    The service is only available in the U.S., Australia, and the U.K. at the time of writing, so not all new iPhones and iPads will come with the stock app installed. 
                    <br><br>
                    Apple News aims to offer a cleanly presented and personalized news service that caters to your tastes and interests, although one of its default behaviors is to spit out alerts from sources that you may or may not be interested in. 
                    Apple News refers to news sources in the app as "channels", and here we are going to run through two ways to control the alerts you receive from them.

                <h2> Apple Leaks Video of macOS 10.14 Showing Xcode 10 With Dark Mode, News App, and More </h2>

                <p> 
                    Steven Troughton-Smith today discovered a brief video on Apple's servers that appears to show Xcode 10 running on macOS 10.14.  
                    <br><br>
                    The well-known developer says he found the 30-second clip buried within an API on the backend of the Mac App Store. 
                    He shared a direct link to the video, embedded below, with 9to5Mac's Guilherme Rambo.

                <h2> Human Curation Sets Apple News Apart From Algorithm-Focused News Sources Like Google and Facebook </h2>

                <p>
                    In a new report by The New York Times today, Apple let a reporter take a glimpse inside the human curation process of its Apple News service. 
                    The article looks into Apple's news strategy (which is focusing less on algorithm-led news curation like its rivals), the service's future integration with Texture magazine subscriptions, and its issues with ad revenue. 
                    <br><br>
                    Providing context, the NYT explains how the rise of Google and Facebook came with news delivery that was driven in part by algorithms. While this enabled the companies to point users towards millions of articles, boosting clicks and shares and driving traffic to various sites, the process ended up sometimes emphasizing articles that were sensational, misleading, highly partisan, or simply false. Although both Facebook and Google have now highlighted methods to fight back against "fake news," some view it as too little too late, and now Apple is taking a different approach.

                <p> 
                    The iOS 12.1 release date is today, and that's going to bring you new features like Group FaceTime, more than 70 new emoji, and eSIM support. 
                    <br><br>
                    The shift from iOS 12 to iOS 12.1 on your iPhone and iPad coincides with the Apple's big iPad Pro and Mac launch event in New York City. 
                    That means additional tweaks to make room for the iPad Pro 2018 may be a part of the software update.

                <p> 
                    But at what point do advertised capacity specs become misleading? 
                    <br><br>
                    Analysis A US district judge has dismissed a false advertising lawsuit against Apple that tried to take the iGiant to task for its bloated mobile operating system.
                    <br><br>
                    Three Apple customers sued the iPhone maker in California back in 2014 after their 16GB iPhone 5s and iPads lost a significant amount of internal storage space when they upgraded to the memory-hungry iOS 8.
                    <br><br>
                    Rather than have the 16GB that had been advertised, the bloatware meant that "anywhere from 18.1-23.1 per cent of this capacity (2.9-3.7 GB) was used by iOS 8 and not available to Plaintiffs for personal storage."

                    Bald person emoji, woozy face, smiling face with three hearts, foot, pleading face, and hot face were among the most engaging and highly-discussed emoji in the iOS 12.1 update, according to research conducted by Emojipedia.  
                    <br><br>
                    The new hairless emoji, bald man and bald woman, was the most popular character, followed closely by woozy face and smiling face with three hearts.

                <h2> Yet another Apple supplier cuts revenue forecast as iPhone pessimism continues </h2>

                <p> 
                    Apple’s rough week continues this evening. 
                    Following pessimistic outlooks from a handful of suppliers and analysts earlier this week, Bloomberg this evening reports that AMS AG, a Face ID component supplier to Apple, has reduced revenue estimates as it heads through the fourth quarter. 
                    <br><br>
                    AMS AG said today that it is projecting Q4 2018 revenue of between $480 million and $520 million. 
                    That’s down from the estimate it gave last month, which called for revenue between $570 million and $610 million. 
                    AMS is attributing this revenue revision to “recent demand changes from a major consumer customer.”

                        <br><br>
                        In day-to-day use, you won’t really need to turn Apple Watch on or off, but there are some cases where it may be needed. 
                        It’s good to also keep in mind in some cases, new Apple Watches may need to be charged before powering on for the first time.
